			<p class="interesting-fact">I'm making this card of my best friend, Jack, 
				but he would likely prefer that I instead take him for a walk around the neighborhood
			</p>
			<ul class="facts">
				<li><span>Alias</span>: <span class="alias">Mr. Keen</span></li>
				<li><span>Daily Activities</span>: Lounging around, begging for food, barking incessantly at the mailman and any stray cats or wild squirrels who dare to enter our yard</li>
				<li><span>Loves</span>: walks outside, hanging out in the kitchen, getting gently scratched on the head, any offering of chicken</li>
				<li><span>Hates</span>: sudden movements, any loud, unexpected noises, cats sitting on stairs waiting for the perfect moment to strike</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Jack weighs no more than ten pounds and his true size as a small dog is concealed by his long, soft toasted marshmallow colored fur.  Since he was rescued from a shelter at a young age, the story behind his missing right-eye remains forever a mystery.  This doesn't create any obstacle whatsoever from him being the cutest dog ever!</p>
